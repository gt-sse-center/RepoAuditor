## Overview

We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#uv) since `RepoAuditor` uses `uv` to create and manage a virtual environment.

### How to use RepoAuditor

<!-- Content below this delimiter will be copied to the generated README.md file. DO NOT REMOVE THIS COMMENT, as it will cause regeneration to fail. -->

Once installed, you can invoke the following to verify if `RepoAuditor` is installed correctly:
```shell
uv run repo_auditor --version
```
and you should see something like
```shell
RepoAuditor vX.X.X
```

To get a list of command line options, you can run
```shell
uv run repo_auditor --help
```

### Personal Access Token (PAT)

The most common use case for `RepoAuditor` would be to audit a GitHub repository.
In order to allow `RepoAuditor` to read the repository, you first need to generate a Personal Access Token or PAT.

Please refer to the [GitHub documentation on Personal Access Tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) for details about a `Fine-grained PAT` which we will be using.

To generate the Fine-grained PAT, we perform the following steps:

1. Go to `Settings -> Developer settings -> Personal Access Token -> Fine-grained tokens`.
2. Click on `Generate new token`.
3. Give the token a name and a description.
4. Set an appropriate expiration date.
5. Under `Repository Access`, select `All repositories`.
6. For permissions, we need to go to `Repository permissions`.
7. Enable Read-Write access to `Contents`, and Read access to `Administration`, `Secret Scanning` and `Dependabot Alerts`.
8. Click on `Generate token`.
9. Copy the generated string. This is your PAT.

After obtaining the PAT, you can save it in a file (e.g. `PAT`) which `RepoAuditor` can read on operation.

### Example Usage

With the above generated PAT file, you can now run `RepoAuditor` on your GitHub repository.
As an example, we will use the [python-helloworld](https://github.com/dbarnett/python-helloworld) repo.

**NOTE** You need to fork the repository since your default PAT only has access to repos under your account.

To run `RepoAuditor`, we can enter the following in the command-line:
```shell
uv run repo_auditor --include GitHub --GitHub-url https://github.com/<username>/python-helloworld --GitHub-pat PAT
```

`RepoAuditor` will generate a series of messages describing all the issues in the repository, along with the rationale behind them and the steps for resolution.

## Installation

| Installation Method | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Via [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) | `uv add repoauditor` |
| Via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) | `pip install repoauditor` |

### Verifying Signed Artifacts
Artifacts are signed and validated using [py-minisign](https://github.com/x13a/py-minisign) and the public key in the file `./minisign_key.pub`.

To verify that an artifact is valid, visit [the latest release](https://github.com/gt-sse-center/RepoAuditor/releases/latest) and download the `.minisign` signature file that corresponds to the artifact, then run the following command, replacing `<filename>` with the name of the artifact to be verified:

```shell
uv run --with py-minisign python -c "import minisign; minisign.PublicKey.from_file('minisign_key.pub').verify_file('<filename>')"
```
