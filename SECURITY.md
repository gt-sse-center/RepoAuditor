# Security

If you find a significant vulnerability, or evidence of one, please report it privately.

<!-- [BEGIN] Submit Vulnerability -->
We prefer that you use the [GitHub mechanism for privately reporting a vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability). Under the [main repository's security tab](https://github.com/gt-sse-center/RepoAuditor/security), in the left sidebar, under "Reporting", click "Advisories", click the "New draft security advisory" button to open the advisory form.
<!-- [END] Submit Vulnerability -->

We will gladly give credit to anyone who reports a vulnerability so that we can fix it. If you want to remain anonymous or pseudonymous instead, please let us know that; we will gladly respect your wishes.

We gladly welcome patches to fix such vulnerabilities! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information about contributions.
