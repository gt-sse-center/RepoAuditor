# Configuration File

`RepoAuditor` accepts both a set of flags as well as a configuration YAML file.

The configuration (or config) file can make usage easier by recording preferences as well as facilitating sharing of enforced requirements within an organization.
We have provided a sample configuration file called [default_config.yaml](https://github.com/gt-sse-center/RepoAuditor/blob/main/default_config.yaml), which can be used as:

```sh
uvx run RepoAuditor --config default_config.yaml
```
