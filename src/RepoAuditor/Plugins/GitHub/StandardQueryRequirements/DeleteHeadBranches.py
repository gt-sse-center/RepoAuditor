                Reasons for this Default
                ------------------------
                - Long-lived branches make integration more difficult due to changes that accumulate over time.

                Reasons to Override this Default
                --------------------------------
                - You support release branches and may want to merge changes from this release branch into the mainline branch
                  (although, it is possible to workaround this issue by creating a pull request from a temporary branch that
                  includes cherry-picked changes from the release branch).
