# Contribution Guidelines

## Contributor Code of Conduct
As contributors and maintainers of this project, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of the level of experience, gender, gender identity, expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

[Project maintainers](MAINTAINERS.md) have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening an issue or contacting one or more of the [project maintainers](MAINTAINERS.md).

## General information
For specific proposals, please provide them as [pull requests](https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/pulls) or [issues](https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/issues) via our [GitHub site](https://github.com/gt-sse-center/RepoAuditor).

The [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) file explains how to install the program locally (highly recommended if you're going to make code changes). It also provides information useful for making changes and validating them locally before submitting a pull request.

### Pull requests and different branches recommended
Pull requests are preferred, since they are specific. For more about how to create a pull request, see https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/.

We recommend creating different branches for different (logical) changes, and creating a pull request into the `main` branch when you're done. See the GitHub documentation on [creating branches](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/) and [using pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

### How we handle proposals
We use GitHub to track proposed changes via its [issue tracker](https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/pulls). Specific changes are proposed using those mechanisms. Issues are assigned to an individual, who works and then marks it complete. If there are questions or objections, the conversation of that issue or pull request is used to resolve it.

### We are proactive
In general we try to be proactive to detect and eliminate mistakes and vulnerabilities as soon as possible, and to reduce their impact when they do happen. We use a defensive design and coding style to reduce the likelihood of mistakes, a variety of tools that try to detect mistakes early, and an automatic test suite with significant coverage. We also release the software as open source software so others can review it.

Since early detection and impact reduction can never be perfect, we also try to detect and repair problems during deployment as quickly as possible. This is especially true for security issues; see our [security information](#vulnerability-reporting-security-issues) for more information.

## Vulnerability reporting (security issues)
Please privately report vulnerabilities you find so we can fix them!

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for information on how to privately report vulnerabilities.
